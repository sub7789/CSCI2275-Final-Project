# CSCI2275-Final-Project
GitHub repository for storing my final project.

Contributor: Sub Mohanty

Initial Plan: Make something like a database with a menu controlled by a linked list with arrays within it, where you are a school administrator and want to store/get/write to a file/etc. data for your students. Each student will have their data stored in a linked list node, with arrays within each node to represent different data such as their SAT scores. Simple pseudocode:

Student *s;

cout << s->SATscores[3] << endl; // will print out their score on their 3rd attempt

Other actions could be creating a text file with an individual student's data if a college requested it, adding a student's new data to the pre-existing text file, creating new students, creating a new tree of a student's past classes and their class trajectory, etc.

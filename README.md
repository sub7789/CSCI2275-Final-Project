## CSCI 2275 Final Project - Visualizing Graph Sorting Algorithms
**Project Summary:** My final project is an extension of our Exam 3 code, with the two main data structures being Graphs and BSTs. My extension is adding several algorithms for sorting through the Graph such as Depth First Search recursive, Depth First Search iterative, Breadth First Search - shortest path, Breadth First Traversal, Dijkstra's Algorithm, and taking the time of how long each algorithm takes to complete. The user is prompted to enter in a word they want to sort to for each respective algorithm, and then the algorithm runs and the time taken is printed out in nanoseconds. After the user has tried all of the different algorithms, the user is presented with a visual bar chart of how long each algorithm took to run.
 **How To Run:**
